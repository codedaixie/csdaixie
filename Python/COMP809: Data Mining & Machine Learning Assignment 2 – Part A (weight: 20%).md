1. Assessment Tasks
The objective of this assignment is to conduct preliminary research on data mining methods used in
various application domains. The survey is intended to assist you in establishing a suitable
framework (application area, tools, algorithms) on which your mining project will be based.
To achieve this objective, you need to follow the steps below:
1. This is an individual assignment.
2. Select a topic based on the application domain listed in Section 2 topics or you can come
up with your own topic but need to confirm it with the teaching team.
3. Read and analyse recent peer-reviewed papers (minimum of 6 articles) on your
specific topic.
4. From your research identify at least two themes and discuss these themes by comparing them
to the various papers in your research. Some examples of themes are listed below:
Approaches/algorithms to solve the problem
Scientific results from experimentation
Perspectives on an issue
Advantages/disadvantages
5. Express your own opinions, e.g., new ideas, proposed approaches/models, how to extend the
existing work, etc. Your opinions about machine learning and data mining related issues
should be presented.
6. Write the report using LaTex / Word. Minimum 4 pages (including references) and
no more than 6 pages in 2 columnsIEEE proceedings format

2. Topics
You can pick one of the following topics or come up with a topic of your interest.
Healthcare
Banking and Finance
Retail, Customer Relationship Management, Product Recommendation
Computer Vision
Fraud Analysis

3. Layout for Research Report
The research report must include:
Title
Abstract
Introduction
Background/motivation
Comparison of related work (from peer-reviewed sources)

(important for efficient marking).
The Section for “Your opinion” is a very important part of the report. In this section, you will
present your own thoughts about the existing works. Based on this you will give your opinion
on how the existing work can be improved further. Your opinions about data mining and
machine learning related issues should be presented. This section should consist of at least
half of a page.
5. What to Submit
Research report in a PDF file.
Note: the above file should be named with your family name and student ID
e.g., Smith_12345.
6. When to Submit
